# 100 Days of Code R1: Topic Log

_This page will be used to log my everyday progress for the first round of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Instead of counting by days, I'll be counting by topic.
The same information can be found on [my blog's topic log](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-log/). For overall goals, please read the following article: [What I Hope To Accomplish During Round 1 of My #100DaysOfCode](www.aniqa.io/100-days-of-code-r1-goals-tasks/)._

_Additionally, to avoid an overly cluttered document, I'll be putting each passing topic into a collapsible section (for example, Topic 0 will be put into a collapsible section after Topic 1 is posted and so forth) and the most latest topic explored will be shown._

---
This log will be updated every time a new topic is being explored with the following:
- The specific topics that I learned
- Any challenges that I've faced and the resolution
- Any updates on projects that I may be working on
- The resources that I am using to learn a specific topic
- Potential plans for the following days

<details><summary><b>Prior to 100 Days Of Code</b></summary>
	
**[Read it on my blog](https://www.aniqa.io/prior-r1/)**
  
To prepare for the start of my learning plan for full stack software development:
  
* I created a [GitHub](http://github.com/aniqatc), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/aniqatc), and [blog](http://aniqa.io).
* I've gotten familiar using GitHub.
* I've been active on Twitter and have connected with over 700 followers in one month.
* I've set up my own self-hosted blog on Ghost and edited the premium theme to customize it to fit my taste. To keep track of changes I made, I created my own documentation for the changes.
* I created a syllabus of my own to follow.
* I researched bootcamps, online courses, Udemy video classes, and other methods of learning to find the best resources to learn from. </details>

<details><summary><b>Topic 0: Web & Internet Protocols</b></summary>

**[Read it on my blog](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-0/)**

After experiencing the *addictiveness of coding*, a part of me just wants to skip all the topics that don't directly pertain to a programming language. But I also want to be a **successful**, *knowledgeable* Full Stack Software Developer ‚Äì in fact, I want that *more*. So, I'm investing in **building a strong foundation**, or at the absolute minimum, understanding basic, foundational topics which I can eventually learn more about in the future if it becomes relevant to potential projects I want to build or to complete tasks at future jobs.

**Topics**

I focused on how the **internet, world wide web, and browser work and communicate** in conjunction with one another to provide us users with a *seamless experience* to connect with others across the globe and to access unlimited information. Initially, I wanted to get through this portion of my learning quickly so that I can become a step closer to building applications but *I have to say* - I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed **learning about the processes powering the platforms** that I use every single day.

Starting from the creation of the Internet to the innovative developments of the Web to all the microprocesses behind the movement of data to display web-pages, I‚Äôve learned so much and have only grown *more* excited to continue on this path. Additionally, I‚Äôve also gained a new appreciation for the Web as previously I took it for granted, as we do with anything that we utilize everyday without thought, but the World Wide Web is quite literally magical.

*Here are the **specific** topics that I learned:*

- üåé History of the Internet starting from ARPANET
- üßÆ Bits, bytes, binary and hexadecimal system
- üìí Internet Protocols (IP) and IP Address
- üéõ Network systems and topologies
- üì¶ IP Packets and Routing
- üåê UDP; TCP/IP Layers; OSI Model
- üîë HTTP (including HTTP Exchanges, HTTP Status Codes, HTTPS and cURL)
- üîé Domain Name System (DNS) and DNS Resolution
- üîí Security
	- SSL & TLS
	- Content Security Protocol (CSP)
	- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- üö® OWASP Top 10 Threats and Prevention
- üñ• Browsers + Rendering Engines

**Challenges & Resolution**

*Fortunately*, I didn‚Äôt face any big hurdle learning today‚Äôs topics. Most of it was informational and not actionable so I really just had to get a basic understanding of the topics which I was able to do. To **ensure that I get a stronger grasp** on the aspects that particularly pertain to web development *(especially security & network protocols and browser processes)*, I‚Äôll be **reviewing my notes** more extensively throughout the week.

**Projects Updates**

Unfortunately, while I do have a *growing* list of project ideas, I‚Äôm not ready to build any software or website just **yet** with the basic HTML and CSS knowledge that I have right now. However, until then, I‚Äôll be working on **writing more articles for my blog**! I have a few ideas that I‚Äôve already created an outline for that include some of the *above-mentioned topics*. Not only will writing blog posts **solidify my understanding of the topics** that I just learned but I hope that it *may help my readers out as well*. As I‚Äôm still in the outlining-and-planning stage, I can‚Äôt really say what the format will be *(long form content or a series or just cheatsheet style)* but it will definitely include topics from Internet, Web, and Browser processes.

**Resources**

I actually used a lot of resources because there wasn't really a standalone source or course that provided coverage of all the topics that I wanted to go over. So, **I used a combination of the following courses, articles, and videos:**

- [Visual list of Web-related topics & resources](https://andreasbm.github.io/web-skills/)
- [Documentation - Webopedia: Tech Dictionary](https://www.webopedia.com/)
- [Documentation - MDN Web Docs: Web Mechanics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions#web_mechanics)
- [Course - Khan Academy's Intro to Computers & Internet](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/)
- [Video - Traversy Media's HTTP Crash Course & Exploration](https://youtu.be/iYM2zFP3Zn0)
- [GitHub Repo - What Happens When A URL Is Inputed in a Browser](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when)
- [Article - How Browsers Work: Behind the Scenes](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/)
- [Documentation - Official OWASP Top 10 List](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [Documentation - MDN Web Docs: Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)

**Tomorrow & Beyond**
1. Start draft for a post about today's topics (which will also count as my review of these topics)
2. **Learn all about Git, GitHub, Command Line Interface, and Chrome Developer Tools**
3. Practice the basic commands that I‚Äôm most likely to use regularly 
</details>


<details><summary><b>Topic 1: Bash/Zsh Command Line</b></summary>

**[Read it on my blog](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-1/)** I recommend the blog version as there is a downloadable book there + just better visuals!

One of the first observations I made when I entered into the world of programming is **that the development process is far more than just writing code and implementing design elements**. There isn‚Äôt just the single process of writing code but _many different processes from the back-end to the front-end to security to databases and more to successfully build and deploy a complete application_. But how can a single person that wants to create full stack applications _handle all_ of those aspects in the creation process? 

Well, it‚Äôs made possible due to the **large range of diverse and helpful developer tools**. There is no end to the type of tools available that a developer can use to smoothen their building process: varying from prototyping software to intuitive modern text editors to remote repository storage systems to programming frameworks to even, viable no-code backend programs ‚Äî _which are all very well-advertised in developer communities._

**Topics**

The **command line**, however, _is not talked about enough in communities of new, aspiring developers_ - or at least, I personally have not seen many people vouch for its usefulness. _Sure_, some of the superior courses may include a few pages or a single video about the command line and how to navigate it at a _basic (almost) non-developer level_, but I find that it‚Äôs a disservice to those that aren‚Äôt informed of the **vast capabilities of the command line**.

Today _(and technically, the past few days)_, I‚Äôve learned just how **useful** of a tool it can be; allowing you to manage your computer‚Äôs filing system, can act as a text editor using [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) or [vim](https://www.vim.org/), provides an outlet to script and run automation tasks, and even, download files and networking information straight from the web using [cURL](https://curl.se/). The command line may look like it‚Äôs an outdated program - _an opinion I had prior to diving into my coursework_ - but in reality, it‚Äôs actually far **more superior, efficient, quick, and advanced than using a Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, the visual interface we usually use to complete tasks on our operating systems. Accessing command line interfaces through the Terminal **only requires a keyboard** because it is a **text-based program** - nothing else is required making it a very fast and quick tool to use.

Clearly, I‚Äôve been won over by what it can do - even though it can be quite complex when you start to get to the advanced parts. Plus, I‚Äôve read a number of [Reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3beyjn/why_is_learning_the_command_line_important/) in which individuals that are far more equipped than me to form well-informed opinions have _endlessly vouched for the command line and its importance to developers of all kinds_. Being that it seems to be a **rare but valued skill**, it might be exactly what I need to stand out amongst the growing lot of junior developers. So on my journey towards learning full stack development, I wanted to make sure that I dedicated time to getting a **proper introduction to the command line** early on so that I can have head-start on getting familiar with it. Learning it before I begin learning programming technologies allows me to utilize the command line from the very start - _meaning_, it'll leave out the guessing or confusion when it comes time to use it for my own builds.

In order to actually use the command line, I use my Macbook‚Äôs built-in **Terminal program to interact with the shell** which specifically uses the Z shell or _zsh_ by default since MacOS has recently adopted it in their latest updates. _Bash_ seems to be the most popular but zsh is said to be almost the exact same but instead, a newer, updated version that has more capabilities, especially when combined with frameworks like Oh-My-Zsh. The [differences aren‚Äôt actually all that significant](https://news.learnenough.com/macos-bash-zshell) or worrisome for beginners; so for the most part, learning the basics of Bash commands has worked fine in my Terminal that is utilizing zsh. Although [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) framework seems like a great way to enhance my Terminal, I haven't installed it yet but hope to do so once I am more comfortable with the shell on its own first.

_Here are the **specific** topics that I learned on an introductory level:_

- ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line
	- Navigating, viewing, and modifying my computer‚Äôs file system
	- Modifying the behavior of commands using flags
	- Combining commands
	- Input and output redirection & using pipes |
	- Search, find, replace, modify file contents & data (specifically .txt, .csv files)
	- Keyboard shortcuts that replace mouse abilities
	- Introduction to Batch Processing
- ‚û∞cURL
	- View HTTP requests/responses
	- Follow webpage redirects
	- Download webpages and files from the web into my filesystem
	- View webpage source code inside the Terminal
	- Combining cURL with simple regular expressions through piping
- üí≤Bash Script: text file containing a series of commands with the extension .sh
	- Variables
	- Conditionals & Comparison Operators
	- Loops
- üêö Shell Variables: variables that are internal to the shell
- üå¶ Environmental Variables: variables that can be used across programs & commands
- üî° Text Editors
	- Using Nano to create, edit, and save files
	- Utilizing .bash_profile to change command prompt and run commands automatically upon opening a new Terminal window
	- Creating aliases to combine complex commands
	- $PS1 and $PATH Variable
	- Introduction to VIM

**Challenges & Resolution**

_I‚Äôll be honest_- I was way more **intimidated by the command line than I should have been**, but once I started to learn the commands and implemented it myself in the Terminal, it was actually **way faster** than using my Finder (the GUI equivalent to the filesystem) and pretty fun to use to navigate my files. _Clearly, learning new things is always an exciting thing for me, whether it's easy or hard._

**However**, I‚Äôd say that only the basic commands to manage the file system and utilizing the Nano text editor to change and set simple variables in _.bash_profile_ are a breeze. Using _cURL_ to pull up specific webpages source code or downloading whole webpage files in HTML wasn‚Äôt so bad _either_. It‚Äôs when you get to the **more advanced commands** where piping or complex redirection is being used that can get slightly confusing, but I attribute that to _needing more hands-on practice._

I believe the only way to get past the confusion of complex, combined commands is to **continue learning and implementing it in my day-to-day wherever possible.** If I don't find a need for the more complex commands just yet then I'll use interactive tools to practice them periodically _(which I've listed below in the resources section)._

The real challenge is learning advanced bash scripting and understanding regular expressions, also known as regexes - which I probably won't get into until after I'm proficient at front-end technologies. I don‚Äôt believe that it could be any worse than learning a programming language, but when I peak ahead at certain documentation, I can‚Äôt say it looks like a breeze either. _I mean, **^([a-zA-Z]+( [a-zA-Z]+)+)$** is probably the scariest looking string I've ever seen - but thank god for [regex generators](https://regex-generator.olafneumann.org/) right?_

Regardless, it‚Äôll be well worth any extra time I need to put in now when I‚Äôm able to set up automation in the future when I‚Äôm actually building and maintaining web applications.

**Projects Updates**

As mentioned in the [Topic 0 post](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-0/), I am not _yet_ building and have allocated the time that I‚Äôd be building **to further researching and writing about the foundational topics** that I‚Äôve been learning which include [web and internet protocols](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-0/), and from today onward, _the command line_. In terms of the post I mentioned outlining on Day 0, I‚Äôve been able to draft a long-form article about web fundamentals in which I share the _importance of learning it and the basic definitions and use cases of the micro-processes behind internet and web protocols._

I‚Äôve also gotten started on building _my own command line cheatsheet for beginners_, which I hope to share next week after I‚Äôve finished the article I‚Äôm currently writing. I know that there are so many cheat sheets out there already - in fact, I share several in this progress post but as I‚Äôve noted several times in my blog, **writing these out in my own words is a form of learning and solidifying knowledge.**

Apart from writing for my blog, I‚Äôve found a few different resources online to continue practicing the fundamentals of the command line - [an online terminal in which I‚Äôm asked to input commands based on the task shown](https://cmdchallenge.com/) or [completing HackerRank challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=bash), or [going through a list of tasks](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-with-intro-to-programming/practice-command-line) using my native Terminal. I've also just been messing around with it on my own as well - in fact, there's a gif on my [blog post version](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-1/) of this update demonstrating a few commands.

_Lastly_, I‚Äôve actually hidden my Finder application from my laptop screen‚Äôs dock so that if I need any files opened, moved, deleted, or changed, **I should only use my Terminal.**

**Resources**

Similar to navigating [web and internet protocol resources](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-0/), I faced the issue of not being able to find *strong standalone resources* to learn the command line and its shell, Bash, beyond the basics. So, I had to use a variety of different courses and documentation to get more out of the topic. In doing so, some of these resources exposed me to **regular expressions (regexes)** and text editors, **Vim** and **Nano**, which I hope to continue learning as I move further along my journey. That being said, I've tried to include different types of resources to fit different needs and also, some may be more advanced for those that want to take it a step further. 

**Here are the sources that were used (& still being used + extras) in my learning:**
