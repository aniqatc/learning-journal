# 100 Days of Code R1: Daily Log

_Welcome to my **daily progress log**!_

_This log is slightly **different** from my [blog's topic log](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-log/) or [my GitHub log](https://github.com/aniqatc/100-days-of-code/blob/main/R1-Topic-Log.md) that I've been contributing to recently. The topic log includes standalone blog posts that include my detailed progress updates on what I've learned, challenges I've faced, projects I'm working on, and the list of resources that were used during my learning over the course of a few days for a **single** topic. I started writing up these 'topic' posts because I didn't want to scatter useful information relating to a single topic across several different posts for several different days. Instead, I grouped the consecutive days together and wrote about my learning experience based on the specified topic (and sub-topics). [Those posts](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-log/) ended up being over 1500 - 2000 words long each so they couldn't be contained into a single log, otherwise, you'd be scrolling forever. Plus, there's just not enough time in the day to do lengthy blog posts everyday while also learning several hours a day._

_For my **daily log**, however, it will be less formal and more simple! I'll be using this daily log **to document my daily progress** regardless of the topic that I'm on - basically how everyone else does it. For those quick, short updates, you can visit this repo (‚≠êÔ∏è it to stay updated); or if you fancy more rich content, then visit the [blog version for my daily updates](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-daily-log/)._

### Day 0

Technically, I posted a ['Day 0' tweet](https://twitter.com/aniqatc/status/1473078287782096899?s=20) so I'll just count that here as my Day 0, even though there's a big gap between my Day 0 update and my Day 1 update. *In my defense, I was still figuring out the structure of how to #LearnInPublic...* But I now have a structure and plan in place so hopefully, there will be a continuous stream of daily updates from Day 1 and beyond.

**Anyways**, here's a quick overview of what Day 0 entailed:

- üåé History of the Internet starting from ARPANET
- üßÆ Bits, bytes, binary and hexadecimal system
- üìí Internet Protocols (IP) and IP Address
- üéõ Network systems and topologies
- üì¶ IP Packets and Routing
- üåê UDP; TCP/IP Layers; OSI Model
- üîë HTTP (including HTTP Exchanges, HTTP Status Codes, HTTPS and cURL)
- üîé Domain Name System (DNS) and DNS Resolution
- üîí Security Protocols (SSL/TLS, CORS)
- üö® OWASP Top 10 Threats and Prevention
- üñ• Browsers + Rendering Engines

**Bonus**: I wrote a blog post called ['Topic 0: Web & Internet Protocols'](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-0/) that provides details on why I chose to learn these topics, the resources I used, and more!

### Day 1

I've spent the past few days learning about Google's Chrome Developer Tools and practiced using almost all of the main features on [my website](https://www.aniqa.io). It was honestly lots of fun messing around with the code, learning more about the security and network protocols that my website is using (which also ties into my understanding of [Web & Internet Protocols](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-0/)), and how to find and fix issues with my code. *There were times that I got lost just using the tool, especially the Element, Console, and Network panels.*

I have so far gone over the following panels: Application, Lighthouse, Adblock, Element, Network, Sources, Security, Console, and customizing Settings. I'm hoping to complete my review of the Memory and Performance tab tomorrow. After doing so, I'll write up my **Topic 2: Chrome Developer Tools** blog post before moving onto my next section of learning.

Side note: I switched my notes over to Nota (a markdown editor) which will make it easier and faster to publish content to my blog more frequently. I'm now working on transforming my blog into a digital garden.
