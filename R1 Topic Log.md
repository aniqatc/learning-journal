# 100 Days of Code R1: Topic Log

_This page will be used to log my everyday progress for the first round of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Instead of counting by days, I'll be counting by topic.
The same information can be found on [my blog's topic log](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-daily-log/). For overall goals, please read the following article: [What I Hope To Accomplish During Round 1 of My #100DaysOfCode](www.aniqa.io/100-days-of-code-r1-goals-tasks/)._

_Additionally, to avoid an overly cluttered document, I'll be putting each passing topic into a collapsible section (for example, Topic 0 will be put into a collapsible section after Topic 1 is posted and so forth) and the most latest topic explored will be shown._

This log will be updated every time a new topic is being explored with the following:
- The specific topics that I learned
- Any challenges that I've faced and the resolution
- Any updates on projects that I may be working on
- The resources that I am using to learn a specific topic
- Potential plans for the following days

**[Read it on my blog](https://www.aniqa.io/prior-r1/)**
  
To prepare for the start of my learning plan for full stack software development:
  
* I created a [GitHub](http://github.com/aniqatc), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/aniqatc), and [blog](http://aniqa.io).
* I've gotten familiar using GitHub.
* I've been active on Twitter and have connected with over 700 followers in one month.
* I've set up my own self-hosted blog on Ghost and edited the premium theme to customize it to fit my taste. To keep track of changes I made, I created my own documentation for the changes.
* I created a syllabus of my own to follow.
* I researched bootcamps, online courses, Udemy video classes, and other methods of learning to find the best resources to learn from. </details>

<b>Topic 0 of 100 Days Of Code: Web & Internet Protocols</b>

**[Read it on my blog](https://www.aniqa.io/r1-topic-0/)**

After experiencing the *addictiveness of coding*, a part of me just wants to skip all the topics that don't directly pertain to a programming language. But I also want to be a **successful**, *knowledgeable* Full Stack Software Developer ‚Äì in fact, I want that *more*. So, I'm investing in **building a strong foundation**, or at the absolute minimum, understanding basic, foundational topics which I can eventually learn more about in the future if it becomes relevant to potential projects I want to build or to complete tasks at future jobs.

**Topics**

I focused on how the **internet, world wide web, and browser work and communicate** in conjunction with one another to provide us users with a *seamless experience* to connect with others across the globe and to access unlimited information. Initially, I wanted to get through this portion of my learning quickly so that I can become a step closer to building applications but *I have to say* - I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed **learning about the processes powering the platforms** that I use every single day.

Starting from the creation of the Internet to the innovative developments of the Web to all the microprocesses behind the movement of data to display web-pages, I‚Äôve learned so much and have only grown *more* excited to continue on this path. Additionally, I‚Äôve also gained a new appreciation for the Web as previously I took it for granted, as we do with anything that we utilize everyday without thought, but the World Wide Web is quite literally magical.

*Here are the **specific** topics that I learned:*

- üåé History of the Internet starting from ARPANET
- üßÆ Bits, bytes, binary and hexadecimal system
- üìí Internet Protocols (IP) and IP Address
- üéõ Network systems and topologies
- üì¶ IP Packets and Routing
- üåê UDP; TCP/IP Layers; OSI Model
- üîë HTTP (including HTTP Exchanges, HTTP Status Codes, HTTPS and cURL)
- üîé Domain Name System (DNS) and DNS Resolution
- üîí Security
	- SSL & TLS
	- Content Security Protocol (CSP)
	- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- üö® OWASP Top 10 Threats and Prevention
- üñ• Browsers + Rendering Engines

**Challenges & Resolution**

*Fortunately*, I didn‚Äôt face any big hurdle learning today‚Äôs topics. Most of it was informational and not actionable so I really just had to get a basic understanding of the topics which I was able to do. To **ensure that I get a stronger grasp** on the aspects that particularly pertain to web development *(especially security & network protocols and browser processes)*, I‚Äôll be **reviewing my notes** more extensively throughout the week.

**Projects Updates**

Unfortunately, while I do have a *growing* list of project ideas, I‚Äôm not ready to build any software or website just **yet** with the basic HTML and CSS knowledge that I have right now. However, until then, I‚Äôll be working on **writing more articles for my blog**! I have a few ideas that I‚Äôve already created an outline for that include some of the *above-mentioned topics*. Not only will writing blog posts **solidify my understanding of the topics** that I just learned but I hope that it *may help my readers out as well*. As I‚Äôm still in the outlining-and-planning stage, I can‚Äôt really say what the format will be *(long form content or a series or just cheatsheet style)* but it will definitely include topics from Internet, Web, and Browser processes.

**Resources**

I actually used a lot of resources because there wasn't really a standalone source or course that provided coverage of all the topics that I wanted to go over. So, **I used a combination of the following courses, articles, and videos:**

- [Visual list of Web-related topics & resources](https://andreasbm.github.io/web-skills/)
- [Documentation - Webopedia: Tech Dictionary](https://www.webopedia.com/)
- [Documentation - MDN Web Docs: Web Mechanics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions#web_mechanics)
- [Course - Khan Academy's Intro to Computers & Internet](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/)
- [Video - Traversy Media's HTTP Crash Course & Exploration](https://youtu.be/iYM2zFP3Zn0)
- [GitHub Repo - What Happens When A URL Is Inputed in a Browser](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when)
- [Article - How Browsers Work: Behind the Scenes](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/)
- [Documentation - Official OWASP Top 10 List](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [Documentation - MDN Web Docs: Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)

**Tomorrow & Beyond**
1. Start draft for a post about today's topics (which will also count as my review of these topics)
2. **Learn all about Git, GitHub, Command Line Interface, and Chrome Developer Tools**
3. Practice the basic commands that I‚Äôm most likely to use regularly
