### Prior to #100DaysOfCode
To prepare for the start of my learning plan for full stack software development:
* I created a [GitHub](http://github.com/aniqatc), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/aniqatc), and [blog](http://aniqa.io).
* I've gotten familiar using GitHub.
* I've been active on Twitter and have connected with over 700 followers in one month.
* I've set up my own self-hosted blog on Ghost and edited the premium theme to customize it to fit my taste. To keep track of changes I made, I created my own documentation for the changes.
* I created a syllabus of my own to follow.
* I researched bootcamps, online courses, Udemy video classes, and other methods of learning to find the best resources to learn from.
